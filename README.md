# Small game SpeedFishby.

The goal of the project was to create a simple game together with the artist.

I had to learn:
- Programming a simple 2D game on Unity
- Interacting with a team member and giving him a task
- Building a project for a mobile device

The artist had to learn:
- create sprites for games
- create backgrounds
- create design UI
- use the git
